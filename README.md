Simple s-expression inspired format for prototyping languages;
implementation in Haskell.

# Why?

As nice as parsec is, if I want to play around with designing a DSL, I
want to get right into the semantics and execution -- if I want rich
surface syntax at all, that can come later.

# What?

A parser and library around a simple s-expression format, designed to be
easy to work with (and convert to other intermediate forms), and
pleasant enough to write by hand. The notion is that it should be a
"good enough" syntax for your minimum viable language.

This is still heavily WIP. Really, come back later.
